NumPy Tutorial for Beginners
NumPy is a powerful Python library for scientific computing. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. NumPy is the foundation for many other popular Python libraries, such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.
In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of NumPy, including how to create and manipulate arrays, perform mathematical operations, and load data from files. We will also cover some advanced indexing techniques.
What is NumPy?
NumPy is a Python library that provides a powerful multidimensional array object. Arrays are a fundamental data structure in scientific computing, and NumPy provides a variety of tools for working with them.
NumPy arrays are similar to Python lists, but they are much more efficient. This is because NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory, and they use fixed types. This means that the computer can read and write data from NumPy arrays much faster than it can from Python lists.
NumPy also provides a variety of mathematical operations that can be performed on arrays. These operations are often much faster than the equivalent operations on Python lists.
Why is NumPy Faster?
NumPy is faster than Python lists for two main reasons:
Fixed Type: NumPy arrays use fixed types, which means that all of the elements in an array must be of the same data type. This allows NumPy to store the data in a more efficient way, and it also makes it easier for the computer to perform operations on the data.
Contiguous Memory: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory, which means that all of the elements in an array are stored next to each other in memory. This makes it much faster for the computer to read and write data from the array.
Applications of NumPy
NumPy is used in a wide variety of scientific computing applications, including:
Mathematics: NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations, such as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
Plotting: NumPy is often used in conjunction with plotting libraries, such as Matplotlib, to create visualizations of data.
Backend: NumPy is the backend for many other popular Python libraries, such as Pandas and Scikit-learn.
Machine Learning: NumPy is used extensively in machine learning, both directly and indirectly. For example, NumPy is used to store and manipulate the data that is used to train machine learning models.
Getting Started with NumPy
To get started with NumPy, you first need to install it. You can do this using the pip command:
pip install numpy
Use code with caution.
Once NumPy is installed, you can import it into your Python code using the following command:
import numpy as np
Use code with caution.
Python
Creating Arrays
There are a variety of ways to create NumPy arrays. Here are a few examples:
From a Python list:
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
Use code with caution.
Python
Using a built-in function:
b = np.zeros((3, 4)) # Create a 3x4 array of zeros
c = np.ones((2, 2, 2)) # Create a 2x2x2 array of ones
d = np.full((2, 2), 99) # Create a 2x2 array of 99s
Use code with caution.
Python
Using a random number generator:
e = np.random.rand(4, 2) # Create a 4x2 array of random decimal numbers
f = np.random.randint(5, 7, size=(3, 3)) # Create a 3x3 array of random integers between 5 and 7
Use code with caution.
Python
Accessing and Changing Specific Elements, Rows, Columns, etc.
You can access and change specific elements of a NumPy array using the same indexing and slicing syntax that is used for Python lists. For example, to access the element at index 1 of the array a, you would use the following code:
a[1]
Use code with caution.
Python
To change the element at index 1 to the value 100, you would use the following code:
a[1] = 100
Use code with caution.
Python
You can also access and change rows and columns of a NumPy array using the same indexing and slicing syntax. For example, to access the first row of the array a, you would use the following code:
a[0, :]
Use code with caution.
Python
To change the first column of the array a to the value 5, you would use the following code:
a[:, 0] = 5
Use code with caution.
Python
Boolean Masking and Advanced Indexing
Boolean masking is a powerful technique for selecting elements from a NumPy array. To use boolean masking, you create a boolean array that has the same shape as the NumPy array you want to select from. The boolean array should have True values for the elements that you want to select, and False values for the elements that you want to exclude.
For example, to select all of the elements in the array filedata that are greater than 50, you would use the following code:
filedata[filedata > 50]
Use code with caution.
Python
You can also use boolean masking to change the values of specific elements in a NumPy array. For example, to set all of the elements in the array filedata that are greater than 50 to the value 100, you would use the following code:
filedata[filedata > 50] = 100
Use code with caution.
Python
Reorganizing Arrays
NumPy provides a variety of methods for reorganizing arrays. One of the most useful methods is reshape(). The reshape() method allows you to change the shape of an array without changing the data that it contains.
For example, to reshape the array before into a 4x2 array, you would use the following code:
after = before.reshape((4, 2))
Use code with caution.
Python
Mathematics
NumPy provides a variety of mathematical operations that can be performed on arrays. These operations are often much faster than the equivalent operations on Python lists.
Here are a few examples of mathematical operations that can be performed on NumPy arrays:
Element-wise arithmetic: You can perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on NumPy arrays. For example, to add 2 to each element of the array a, you would use the following code:
a + 2
Use code with caution.
Python
Matrix multiplication: You can perform matrix multiplication on NumPy arrays using the np.matmul() function. For example, to multiply the matrices a and b, you would use the following code:
np.matmul(a, b)
Use code with caution.
Python
Linear algebra: NumPy provides a variety of linear algebra functions, such as np.linalg.det() for calculating the determinant of a matrix, and np.linalg.inv() for calculating the inverse of a matrix.
Statistics: NumPy provides a variety of statistical functions, such as np.min(), np.max(), and np.sum().
